I implimented a model using adult.csv data set for classifying individual’s annual income from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc. This project is organised as follows:

(a) extract features from data set.
(b) data preprocessing and split into train and test data for a given model.
(c) Predict the output of the test cases using KNN algorithm. 
(e) observed the summary of model.

adult.csv: data set for given model

Result:
1. accuracy:0.7647232254735756
